# Check-LocalAdminHash
Check-LocalAdminHash is a PowerShell tool that attempts to authenticate to multiple hosts over either WMI or SMB using a password hash to determine if the provided credential is a local administrator. It's useful if you obtain a password hash for a user and want to see where they are local admin on a network. It is essentially a Frankenstein of two of my favorite tools along with some of my own code. It utilizes Kevin Robertson's (@kevin_robertson) Invoke-TheHash project for the credential checking portion. Additionally, the script utilizes modules from PowerView by Will Schroeder (@harmj0y) to enumerate domain computers to find targets for testing admin access against.
